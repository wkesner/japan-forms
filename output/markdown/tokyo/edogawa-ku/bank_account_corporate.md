# Corporate Bank Account Opening (Business Manager Visa) (法人口座開設申込書) — Edogawa Ward (江戸川区)

> **Form name:** 法人口座開設申込書 (Hōjin Kōza Kaisetsu Mōshikomisho)
> **Also called:** 法人口座開設, 法人名義口座
> **Cost:** ¥0 (Free to open. Monthly fees vary — some banks charge ¥0, megabanks may charge ¥2,000-5,000/month for corporate accounts.)
> **Deadline:** No legal deadline. In practice, you need a corporate account to transfer capital from your personal account after incorporation and to begin business transactions.
> **Penalty:** No penalty for delay, but operating without a corporate account creates accounting problems and reduces credibility with business partners.

---

⚠️ **Difficulty:** HIGH — Corporate account opening is one of the most difficult steps for foreign entrepreneurs in Japan. Banks reject applications frequently, especially from newly incorporated companies. Plan for 2-4 weeks of processing and possible rejection from your first-choice bank.

⏰ **Timing:** Open your corporate account AFTER company registration but BEFORE applying for (or renewing) your Business Manager visa, as immigration wants to see the capital properly transferred to a corporate account.

💡 **Strategy:** Apply to multiple banks simultaneously. Start with Japan Post Bank or a regional/online bank (higher approval rate), then try megabanks later once you have transaction history.

## Business Manager Visa Requirements

**Capital:** ¥30,000,000 (raised from ¥5,000,000 in October 2025)

The capital must be deposited into your personal account first (as proof of funds during incorporation), then transferred to the corporate account after registration. Banks and immigration both want to see this paper trail.

**Employees:** 2+ full-time employees (both capital AND employee requirements must be met since October 2025)

**Japanese ability:** JLPT N2 or equivalent required for at least the applicant or one full-time employee (since October 2025)

**Office:** Banks strongly prefer a dedicated physical office. Virtual offices and residential addresses are frequently rejected. Lease agreement will be requested.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Going straight to a megabank as a brand new company** — Megabanks reject most new foreign-owned companies. Start with Japan Post Bank, GMO Aozora, or a local credit union (信用金庫). Build transaction history first.

**Using a virtual office as your registered address** — Banks view virtual offices as a red flag for shell companies. Get a dedicated physical space, even a small one. Co-working spaces with fixed desks and lease agreements can work.

**Not having a company website or any web presence** — Banks will Google your company. A professional website proves legitimacy. Even a simple bilingual one-page site with your business description, team, and contact info helps enormously.

**Using your registered seal (代表印) as your banking seal** — Create a separate banking seal (銀行印). If your registered seal is compromised, your bank account is too. Most seal shops (はんこ屋) can make a set of corporate seals.

**Applying before your company registration is complete** — You cannot open a corporate account without your Certificate of Registered Matters (登記事項証明書). Wait until registration is complete, then get fresh copies (within 6 months).

**Not being able to explain your business clearly in Japanese** — The branch interview will be in Japanese. If your Japanese isn't business-level, bring a trusted Japanese-speaking colleague or hire a professional interpreter for the appointment.

**Giving up after one rejection** — Rejection is normal, especially from megabanks. Apply to 2-3 banks simultaneously. If rejected, ask why, improve your materials, and try a different bank.

**Not transferring capital to corporate account promptly** — Immigration wants to see capital in a corporate account (not sitting in your personal account). Transfer promptly after opening and keep the receipt as proof for visa renewal.

## Screening Tips (How to Get Approved)

**Have a real website ready before applying** — Banks check your company website during screening. A professional site with your company name, services, contact info, and team page dramatically improves your chances. Even a simple one-page site helps.

**Physical office > virtual office > residential address** — Banks want to see your lease agreement. Virtual office addresses (バーチャルオフィス) are red flags. A small dedicated office or co-working membership with a fixed desk is much better.

**Bring a business plan in Japanese** — Even if the bank doesn't require it, having a well-written 事業計画書 in Japanese shows seriousness. Include: business description, target market, revenue model, 3-year projections, and how the account will be used.

**Apply to easier banks first, then upgrade** — Start with Japan Post Bank, GMO Aozora, or a regional bank (信用金庫). Once you have 6+ months of transaction history, megabanks become much more approachable.

**The representative director MUST be a Japan resident** — Non-resident directors almost always get rejected. If you haven't received your Business Manager visa yet, use a co-director who already has residency.

**Dress professionally for the branch visit** — Corporate account opening often includes an in-person interview at the branch. Dress as you would for a business meeting. First impressions matter in Japanese business culture.

**Bring any existing contracts or client relationships** — Purchase orders, service agreements, or letters of intent from real companies prove your business is legitimate and operational — not a shell company.

**Be specific about account usage** — When asked 利用目的, don't just say '事業用'. Explain: 'We receive payments from X clients, pay Y suppliers, and handle Z operational costs monthly.' Specificity builds trust.

## If Your Application Is Rejected

Corporate account rejection is extremely common for foreign-owned companies. Banks are rarely required to give specific reasons. Common unstated reasons include:

- Company too new (under 6 months since incorporation)
- Virtual or residential office address
- No visible business activity (no website, no clients, no contracts)
- Representative director not a Japan resident
- Business description too vague or inconsistent with Articles of Incorporation
- Industry perceived as high-risk (crypto, money transfer, consulting with no clear clients)
- Insufficient paid-in capital for the stated business scope

**What to do next:**

- Ask the bank for feedback (they may give hints even if not required to)
- Strengthen your weak points and apply to a different bank
- Consider a credit union (信用金庫) — they serve local businesses and may be more flexible
- Build 3-6 months of real business activity, then reapply
- Consult with a judicial scrivener (司法書士) or administrative scrivener (行政書士) who specializes in foreign business setup
