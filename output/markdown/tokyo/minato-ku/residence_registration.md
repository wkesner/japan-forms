## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Writing name in romaji instead of katakana** — Most forms want katakana (カタカナ). Ask staff for help converting your name.

**Using arrival date instead of move-in date** — 異動日 is when you moved into your apartment, not when your flight landed.

**Leaving head of household (世帯主) blank** — If you live alone, you ARE the head of household. Write your own name.

**Forgetting Japanese translations of certificates** — Marriage/birth certificates need a Japanese translation with the translator's name stated. A friend can do it — no certified translator required.

**Not bringing all household members' Residence Cards** — You need every person's Zairyu Card, including children.
