3. **インターネットバンキングの設定** — Set up online/mobile banking — login credentials often arrive in a separate envelope.
4. **口座番号を勤務先・不動産会社に伝える** — Share your account number with employer (payroll) and landlord (rent auto-debit).
5. **公共料金の自動引き落とし設定** — Set up auto-debit (口座振替 kōza furikae) for utilities, phone, internet.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Going to a megabank within your first 6 months** — Start with Japan Post Bank — they accept 3+ month residence. Open a megabank account later if needed.

**Writing name in romaji instead of katakana on the form** — Your account name MUST be in katakana. Practice writing your name beforehand or ask staff for help.

**Not having a Japanese phone number** — Get a prepaid SIM first (available at convenience stores and electronics shops with just a passport). Banks need to call or SMS you.

**Being vague about account purpose** — Banks are required to ask why you need the account (anti-money laundering). Say '給与受取と生活費' (salary and living expenses) — concrete and normal.

**Middle name problems** — Japanese systems expect exactly two names (surname + given). If you have middle names, you may need to omit them or combine them with your first name. Make sure your bank name matches your Residence Card name exactly.

**Arriving after 3 PM** — Bank branch counters close at 3 PM sharp (some at 4 PM). Arrive by 2 PM latest to allow time for processing.

**Not bringing both Residence Card AND passport** — Some branches want both even if the website says one is enough. Bring everything to avoid a wasted trip.

**Choosing a birthday as your PIN** — Banks may reject PINs that match your birthday, phone number, or sequential numbers (1234). Pick something unrelated.

## Middle Name Problems

Japanese name systems expect exactly one surname and one given name. Most banking systems have character limits (often 20-30 katakana) and no concept of middle names. This causes real problems for people with long or multi-part names.

**Combine first + middle as one given name:** John Michael Smith → ジョン マイケル スミス or ジョンマイケル スミス — *Most common approach. Must match your Residence Card.*

**Drop the middle name:** John Michael Smith → ジョン スミス — *Only if your Residence Card also shows it this way. May need to register a 通称 (alias) at city hall.*

**Register a legal alias (通称, tsūshō):** Go to your ward office with supporting documents (employment certificate, etc.) — *Cleanest long-term solution. Your alias appears on Residence Card, My Number, and bank records.*

## Minato Ward-Specific Notes

- Japan Post Bank branches are everywhere in Minato — the Roppongi and Shiba Park branches see many foreign customers.
- SMBC Prestia has flagship branches in Roppongi and Akasaka with full English-speaking staff — highly recommended for personal accounts.
- MUFG's Roppongi branch is accustomed to foreign customers due to the embassy district.
- Arrive before 2 PM. The Azabu post office is less crowded than Roppongi for JP Bank account opening.
