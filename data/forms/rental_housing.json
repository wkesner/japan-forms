  "overview": {
    "difficulty_en": "HARD — Japan's rental market is notoriously difficult for foreigners. Many landlords refuse foreign tenants outright. You'll need a guarantor company (保証会社), and the screening process involves income verification and sometimes a phone interview in Japanese. The upfront costs are extremely high compared to other countries. However, once you're in, tenant protections are very strong — landlords cannot easily evict you or raise rent.",
    "timing_en": "Start searching 4-6 weeks before your desired move-in. Peak moving season is January-March (new fiscal year starts April 1). Listings move fast — a good apartment may be gone within days. Off-peak months (May-August, October-December) have less competition and sometimes lower key money.",
    "strategy_en": "Use a foreigner-friendly real estate agency (不動産屋). UR Housing (公団) requires no key money, no guarantor, and accepts foreigners — but units are older and less central. If your employer offers housing assistance, USE IT — company-backed applications almost never get rejected. For the first few months, consider a furnished apartment, share house, or monthly mansion while you learn the market."

      "tip_en": "Have your emergency contact ready",
      "detail_en": "The guarantor company WILL call your emergency contact. Brief them in advance: they may be asked to confirm your name, that they know you, and their willingness to be contacted if needed. A Japanese-speaking contact is ideal."

      "tip_en": "Apply to multiple properties simultaneously",

      "tip_en": "Avoid properties that say '外国人不可' (foreigners not accepted)",

      "tip_en": "Higher income proof helps enormously",

      "No emergency contact in Japan — find a coworker, friend, or use your company HR",

    {
      "mistake_en": "Ignoring the 'no foreigners' reality",
      "fix_en": "Many listings quietly refuse foreign applicants even if not stated. Use a foreigner-focused agency (GTN, Sakura House, Real Estate Japan) or ask your employer for help. Don't waste time on agencies that seem uncomfortable with foreign clients."
